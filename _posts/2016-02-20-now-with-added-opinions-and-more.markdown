After 2 years I've decided to move home here to abuxton.github.io. A new future brings my opinions into sharp focus. That being the case I guess I should have an opinion that not only matters! But is known, and backed up with my trains of thought, reasonings and observations.

I don't have a opinion on everything in tech, or most things outside tech to be honest. I may have the odd rant, a comment or two on other peoples opinions! and I may well try out some peoples thoughts and views and report back on whether they were right, wrong or i found something better.

Any way that's enough for now.
