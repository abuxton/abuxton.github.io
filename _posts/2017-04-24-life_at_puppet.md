Breathing life back into my life! What a difference a year makes.

A year to the day almost exactly since I left for pastures new I found my self sat in Puppets new 13th floor london office. I was about to pull a new hoody on, new logo, new mission statement, new management same company. Now a week or two in, Puppet is Puppet the product is same, same but different. This is #lifeatpuppet.

A year out of Puppet and 13 months since I last posted, I return. Were did I go? I dabbled in public sector and contracting, I moved from simple subject matter expert in regards DevOps, automation and Configuration managment to Product manager, and Project manager for a cloud adoption project. It was a challenge, actual it was several sometimes all at once. There was love and hate, long nights and days. Now i'm back, I'm going to take some of my experiance and learning, and I'm going to add some advice from (https://nextgendevops.com/)[https://nextgendevops.com/] and try put them into weekly posts on a range of subjects.
